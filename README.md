Hello,

In AERE 361 I am interested in learning more C and Python Coding.
I have been doing a lot of work on a balance control system for the AABL Wind Tunnel. This control system consist of a Raspberry Pi and Arduino Mega serial system with an advanced I/O system. I also am a lab tech for the Icing/De-Icing Wind Tunnel.

I am a very avid rock climber and racquetball player.
